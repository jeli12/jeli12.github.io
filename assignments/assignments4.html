    <h3> challenge 5: accessibility concerns </h3>
        In challenge 1, my navigation bar still needs improvement
        as my home and about page don't currently have a link. This makes it
        difficult for the viewer as they would be re-directed to a nonexistent
        page. Additionally, I am trying to figure out how to make the navigation bar
        look more aesthetically pleasing. In challenge 3,the viewer will be able to
        enter in their information, however, it won't redirect them as the form is not
        linked to a certain database that stores the entered information. Something
        that will help with the accessibility would be creating a submit or register
        button that the viewer can click on for the information to be sent somewhere
        once it is linked. With challenge 3, I could also work on adding a female/male/other
        circle option that allows the viewer to select their gender by clicking on it
        rather than filling it out.
