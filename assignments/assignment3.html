      <p>Salted pork belly first appeared in China. In Middle English the
        term bacon or bacoun referred to all pork in general.Before the industrial
        revolution, bacon was generally produced on local farms and in domestic kitchens.</p>

      <h3 id="around-the-world-section">Around The World</h3>
      <p>Japan(ベーコン): bacon is pronounced "bēkon". Bacon in Japan is different from that
        in the US in that the meat is not sold raw, but it is processed, precooked, and has a ham
        like consistency when cooked.
        Canada: Canadian-style back bacon is a lean cut from the eye of the pork loin
        with little surrounding fat. Peameal bacon is an unsmoked back bacon, wet-cured and coated
        in fine grounf cornmeal and is popular in southern Ontatio.
        Germany: Germans use the term bacon explicitly for Frühstücksspeck ('breakfast Speck')
        which are cured or smoked pork slices. Small bacon cubes (called Grieben or Grammerln in
        Austria and southern Germany) have been a rather important ingredient of various southern German dishes.
        They have been sold ready made as convenience foods recently as Baconwürfel
        ("bacon cubes") in German retail stores."</p>
      <h3 id="bacon-dishes-section">Bacon Dishes</h3>
      <p>Bacon dishes include bacon and eggs, bacon, lettuce, and tomato (BLT) sandwiches, Cobb salad, and various
        bacon-wrapped foods, such as scallops, shrimp, and asparagus. Steaky bacon is more commonly used as a topping
        in the US on items such as pizza, salads, sandwiches, hamburgers, baked potatoes, hot dogs, and soups. In the US,
        sliced smoked back bacon is used less frequently than the streaky variety, but can sometimes be found on pizza, salads, and omelettes.</p>
